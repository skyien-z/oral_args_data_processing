## Cases and Transcripts
Cases and transcripts from Oyez's API and [[Walker Boyle's repo](https://github.com/walkerdb)] with the following additional steps:
* Removed cases prior to 1991, the first year that the most senior justice, Clarence Thomas, was on the bench.
* Updated cases & transcript to extend to the end of the 2024-2025 SCOTUS term.
* Removed cases without corresponding transcripts. This involved regrabbing 12 cases from 2017 where the case history suggested there was no transcript at the time the history was grabbed, but where the transcripts are currently available via the Oyez API.

Note: we use <<year>>.<<docket>> as a unique id because some dockets are not unique across years.
