The second class of rights that are at stake are those procedural and evidentiary rights that would go to the reliability of the defendant's conviction; so, for example, Fourth Amendment rights against search and seizure or Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. And the Court has held in Tollet and in the Brady trilogy that those rights need not be affirmatively waived but are effectively foreclosed by the plea of guilty, because -- once a defendant pleads guilty, we're no longer worried, for example, about whether the evidence against him was properly obtained. But the third category of rights, which are the rights at stake here, are those which -- where the defendant is saying that the government cannot obtain a valid conviction against me regardless of the procedures that are used, regardless of the evidence that is amassed."

The factual response is that if you read the remainder of the sentence, which is on Joint Appendix 63, the Court says if you believe your plea was somehow unlawful or involuntary or if there is some other fundamental defect in these guilty plea proceedings, I think it's properly understood to go to the kinds of procedural claims that everyone understands you can bring after a guilty plea, such as that your plea was not knowing and intelligent. The Court again -- and this is on page 76 -- tells the defendant that the plea agreement actually precludes him from challenging his conviction on appeal, which isn't correct, but if he thought he had wanted to actually bring an appeal challenging his conviction, he might have spoken up at that point. But the broader legal point is that this Court has made clear any number of times that a defendant need not be subjectively aware of everything that he is giving up in a plea in order for the plea to be a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights."

Because when I look at those cases, the language that we use seems totally consistent with the theory that Justice Gorsuch and Justice Breyer raised, and not consistent with yours. So when they were talking about what -- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty plea, they say, well, where you have a right not to be hailed into court at all, they say where the charge is one that the state cannot constitutionally prosecute; that last one is from Menna, and they say where the court had no power to enter the conviction; that last one is from Broce. So, in all three of those cases, the language used is where, you know, in the end you find that the -- that you've -- you've -- you've done the facts, you've satisfied the elements, but still the state can't prosecute you constitutionally or properly. And that's exactly what fits with Justice Gorsuch's and Justice Breyer's theory. Three -- three times we've said it."

And, third, I don't think anything that this Court said in Blackledge and Menna reflects that they're really the tip of the iceberg that would allow claims by all sorts of defendants. In those cases, you had the court outside the context of any sort of conditional plea procedure asking whether there's any recourse for a defendant who wanted on the one hand to plead guilty and on the other hand to preserve a claim that he was charged under -- he was charged for primary conduct for which he'd already been charged and convicted."

I want to make one more point about appeal waivers, to get back to Justice Kagan's question earlier, which is I wouldn't want to sit down without informing the Court that there are -- 25 percent of the pleas in the federal system don't even involve plea agreements. They're open pleas. And when a defendant enters a plea without an agreement and the district court and the government have every expectation that that ends the case, the defendant should not be able silently to reserve a challenge to the substance of the conviction that the defendant assented to the court entering."

Briefly, just to address the colloquy, I just want to point out that the colloquy cannot waive the defendant's rights because it is, first of all, a third-party that the defendant would be effectively contracting with when there is no plea waiver or no appeal waiver in his plea agreement. And that the plea agreement itself has an integration clause, which says that it comprises the totality of the agreement between the government and that anything further will be entered into in writing. Finally, as to Mr. Feigin's point about the potential information imbalance and the government not getting the information that it needs in pleading guilty, as this Court has recognized, it takes practicalities into -- into account. And here, if there's any imbalance, it is on the defendant."
