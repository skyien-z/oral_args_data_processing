Now maybe the closer question is when an attorney comes in after the case is over on a separate docket number and asks for compensation and a court doesn't want to award that because that decision, the attorney's fee decision after the case is finished, doesn't actually interfere with the representation. So you can make an argument that it's not part of the case or controversy, but as long as the decision under 3599 about resources affects the representation, then it's appealable."

What the court cannot do and what the Fifth Circuit regularly does under its substantial need rule is say, oh, we're going to guess about what the record on B looks like. We're going to speculate about what you're going to find when you go out and you look for this mitigation evidence or this evidence of materiality, and we're going to -- we're going to guess, based on that estimation, that you're not going to meet that showing on element B.

And it's also the desirable rule because it gives effect to the dominant purpose of the statute, which is to promote parity in representation as between those capable of paying for it and those who aren't. And, finally, it's a really good standard because it's workable."
