Had Congress meant for courts of appeals to review all national or definitional rules, it would have said so, as it did in the Clean Air Act, instead of listing a handful of particular EPA actions down to the statutory subsection. Our textual approach to subsections (b)(1) and (E) -- (b)(1)(E) and (F) results in a comparatively clear jurisdictional rule that would eliminate many duplicative filings and years of litigation over where to litigate."

And none of the challengers here have explained throughout the briefing or here today why it is that Congress would want to bifurcate the geographic aspects of limitations under Section 1311 from the numerical aspects.

But here where you're defining, in effect, discharge of a pollutant, which is defined as discharge into the \"waters of the United States,\" you are expanding or contracting the scope of the prohibition under Section 1311. And that's why it's the equivalent of a rule that says on the following waters you shall not discharge pollutants under Section 1311. That would certainly be a limitation that's promulgated under Section 1311 and it's exactly what's happened here."

And so then I think it goes to the point that Justice Ginsburg made and what this Court said in DuPont, which is if the individual -- if this decision, when in the context of an individual proceeding would go to the court of appeals and, you know, here, in the context of an individual permitting decision, a \"waters of the United States\" decision would go to the court of appeals, then it doesn't make sense for a categorical rule about that to go to the district court. And courts of appeals sort of starting from Crown Simpson have adopted that approach. And so they've said sort of the basic rules that are sort of thresholds to whether you can get a permit or not go to the courts of appeals."
