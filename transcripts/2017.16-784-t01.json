And what Congress tried to do in 546(e) was to provide a nice bright-line rule that protects these intermediaries, and it seems like it is consistent with both the general interest and the bright-line nature of the rule to say this is relatively straightforward, let's look at the transfer the trustee is seeking to avoid."

And so I think what Congress was trying to do with 546(e) was to provide an alternative, more bright-line way for the financial intermediaries to get out of the case early at the motion to dismiss stage. And the problem with this looking for the beneficial ownership is it's really the same inquiry, and it could be fact-specific in a particular case, that Congress was trying to supplement with this bright-line rule. And we think our rule gives a nice bright-line rule that courts can apply at the motion to dismiss stage, literally just look at the complaint, look at the transfer the trustee's seeking to avoid, and then, if it satisfies 546(e), you know, you're done, trustee loses."

You know, when you have this provision applied in the context of a very large transaction on the public markets, there are lots of the trustees' prima facie case, including that there wasn't sufficient value provided and the like, those are going to be relatively difficult to prove, I mean, at least if you believe in sort of the efficiencies of markets. But when you have leveraged buyouts for small companies, I mean, that is a fertile ground for essentially getting money out of the company and away from unsecured creditors and to some favored party. So as -- as the trustee's amicus brief said, to sort of carve out, you know, leveraged buyouts from the fraudulent avoidance laws, that's carving out a lot because these are transactions where there is a risk that's quite considerable to mulcting the interest of the unsecured creditors. The last thing I'll say before I sit down is just, in addition to all the other textual arguments we make in the brief, I do think it's worth emphasizing that, under their view of the statute, Congress's effort in 2005 to add financial participants as the sixth on the list of protected entities was completely superfluous and just a fool's errand, because I can't imagine that financial participants who are defined as entities with $100 million or a billion dollars in transactions were doing those transactions with cash. So those financial participants were already customers of these five entities, so if that's enough to bring you into the statute, Congress was utterly wasting its time in 2005."

I mean, look, normally, I don't think you really draw any inference through -- from the amici that aren't here, but, you know, if you told me that, wow, there's this provision that's in the code that's specifically designed to protect your interests, and the Seventh Circuit adopted a narrow construction of it, and it's going up to the Supreme Court of the United States, and they will decide the scope of this exemption that protects your industry, I mean, if -- if you had any thought that you were not fully protected by the Respondent's view as much as the Petitioner's view, I would think it would be worth your while to file an amicus brief.
