The question before the Court this morning is, what does it mean for a period of limitations to be tolled? The Court should hold that \"tolled\" means suspended, an interpretation that accords with the plain meaning of the word \"tolled.\" That is the definition given in Black's Law Dictionary, and that is the way \"tolled\" is used in every other statute that uses the word \"tolled,\" none of which would make any sense under Respondent's interpretation."

And so, therefore, we think that the -- the correct interpretation is to say that the clock stops, which is perfectly consistent with the fact that the statute defines the tolling period as both the pendency of the federal claim and 30 days thereafter. And just one other comment about the fact that the period of limitations is tolled while the claim is pending in federal court. So, if the statute just said that, if the statute just said the period of limitations is pending -- is tolled while the claim is pending in federal court, period, full stop, then I think there would be no debate as to what it means."

There is some debate among the members of the Court in the Comstock case about how much latitude, but everyone agrees that there is some latitude."

But then she could surprise a defendant by saying two years, three years, four years, and I think this is especially significant in employment cases where you're looking at back-pay awards that run from the time of the adverse employment action, there is a chance for gamesmanship by the plaintiff, which would not happen if we were looking at this as a 30-day period from while the claim is pending and after its dismissal. But I -- I do want to get back to just the structure of the statute as a whole because I think that the provision of this 30-day period, because it is a rarity within the U.S. Code, suggests Congress was doing something other than stop-clock tolling. And I think combined with this self-conscious legislation that defers to state tolling periods, of which this Court was aware, of which Congress was aware, when they were enacting this statute. And so 1367(d) is a precise fit to the problem created by 1367(c)."
