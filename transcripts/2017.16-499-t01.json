But if I could return to Justice Alito's question, so, first of all, there's a mismatch between their theory and the solution. There are other doctrines more available. And just imagine other situations.

So what do you say about that? And then relatedly, if international law was not part of the federal law itself in 1789, and I think there is an argument that that's what the Congress understood too, then don't you need an American defendant in order to have diversity jurisdiction?"

And as the United States points out, that also satisfies touchy concern if that gets litigated on remand. Now, Justice Kagan, to turn to your question, we just don't think -- it's just a red herring to point to all of the various banking regulations that exist in the world. We're not proceeding under any banking regulations. You know, the bank would like to tell a story to this Court about it being a negligent and innocent actor in this -- in this scenario, but that's not what the factual allegations are and it's not even what the district court has found that we proved in the ATA part of this case. What we allege is knowing and purposeful financing of terrorism with the expectation that it will make those terrorism attacks more successful and more lucrative for the perpetrators, and that is a violation of the law of nations. The Court does not need to worry that there is going to be a flood of lawsuits against banks or any other financial actors if we are allowed to go forward in this case eventually on our substantive claims --"

And, obviously, this Court's decision in Kiobel cuts back on that concern because it makes clear that the claims have to actually touch and concern the United States, and so it might alter the analysis there."

Now, when you look at this case, what they've cited is, for example, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which we've ratified, which says that states must take necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable.

Instead, it specifies that it is only -- their own -- other countries are only supposed to impose liability when someone in a control or management position commits one of the primary violations under Article II of the convention. So that's not an American conception of corporate liability."

So you're going to -- my humble point to you is, yeah, at first blush it might seem a little weird that the U.S. corporation is not a defendant, but there are plenty of other potential U.S. defendants that will avoid the diplomatic friction. And then the costs on the other side of allowing the foreign corporations to be sued, if you applied the same logic here, this suit wouldn't happen.

I don't think it's an accident that each time you get one of these foreign cubed cases, that it's a foreign corporation, I don't think it's an accident that each time it comes up, it's really attractive to maybe duck the corporate liability question and decide the extraterritoriality question. First of all, thank goodness we don't really have a lot of U.S. corporations that are violating international law right here in America, but if they did, there would be plenty of defendants under the ATS and under other provisions. So the real incidence of this, the real impact of corporate liability is the ability to get a company -- a corporation like Arab Bank that's a cornerstone of the Jordanian economy, and you get them in here, you cause all sorts of diplomatic friction and then, as a bonus, you don't have to worry about whether the -- the mens rea of somebody in Jordan and the mens rea of somebody who processed the transaction in the United States, whether any of those actually satisfied the requirements of the tort, because you can mush them all together and say it's corporate responsibility.
