But equally possible would be to encourage state intermediate courts to say less and perhaps take advantage of Harrington, so that no state court says anything and achieves maximum deference from federal courts, like California has, for example. Should we be concerned that a ruling in favor of look-through might actually yield if states are rational and look for the least cost and the most deference adverse consequences to your -- your -- your clients?"

But on the practical side of things, and as the Eleventh Circuit explained below, I think in practice the federal habeas court when assessing the Georgia Supreme Court summary denial on the merits will first look to the lower court to see if the lower court's reasoned opinion offers any reasonable basis. And so, in many cases, the process would be very similar."

Here, asking this Court to make sure that the Georgia Supreme Court or any higher state court of the land does not have infirm reasoning imputed on it when they are faced with both reasonable and unreasonable bases on which to sustain the denial of relief also serves comity and is the best -- and is in service of federalism and comity in that set of cases where it matters the most, when that lower state court may contain an infirmity.
