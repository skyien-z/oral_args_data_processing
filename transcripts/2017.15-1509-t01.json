Now, it seems to me that on the first case you would have a good reason for saying: Well, when the court tries to elaborate a test and considers factors and considerations, those things are more a part of the legal inquiry.

It would say that as a matter of looking at the prong, whether the -- in conducting a totality analysis, as to whether parties are sufficiently close, courts should take into account certain types of characteristics. I still would submit that that ultimately is a factual determination, and it's highly fact-intensive. But even if you disagree and you think this is more like a mixed question, that you need to define the legal standard and need to apply it to the facts of this case, under this Court's functional approach, asking which judicial actor is better positioned to decide these questions, we think the factors weigh overwhelmingly in favor of clear error review."

And so I do think that the result of that is that even if there might be more legal-sounding questions with respect to closeness, it's not really an independent prong of the test so much as folding into it. The arm's length test itself is comparable in some ways to this Court's decision in Commissioner versus Duberstein, and that case dealt with what is a gift for purposes of the Tax Code? And this Court said, you know, that's not a pure intent question, but it is essentially a factual inference drawn from all of the other facts. What we're trying to get at is, what is the dominant motive for how these parties are interacting? And that's going to be a factual inference, and it's going to be reviewed for clear error."
