  "facts_of_the_case": "<p>Shortly after taking office on January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order titled \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship.\u201d This Order declared that certain individuals born in the United States would not be granted U.S. citizenship at birth if their mothers were either in the country illegally or temporarily and if their fathers were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Specifically, the Order directed federal agencies not to issue or recognize documents affirming U.S. citizenship for individuals born under these circumstances after February 19, 2025. The Order further mandated that agencies revise their policies and issue guidance to implement these new rules. The interpretation marked a dramatic shift from long-standing constitutional and statutory understandings of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause, which has historically been viewed as providing birthright citizenship to nearly all individuals born in the U.S., regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status.</p>\n<p>In response to the Executive Order, lawsuits were quickly filed in multiple federal district courts\u2014specifically in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington\u2014by states, organizations, and individuals who would be affected. These plaintiffs argued that the Order violated the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act. All three district courts issued preliminary injunctions blocking the enforcement and implementation of the Executive Order nationwide. The federal government appealed the injunctions, arguing that the lawsuits should only apply to the specific plaintiffs and not the entire country, and also requested permission for government agencies to continue internal planning for implementation. Appeals courts declined to limit the injunctions, prompting the federal government to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to partially stay the orders\u2014specifically to allow agency planning and to restrict injunctive relief to the named plaintiffs only.</p>\n",
  "question": "<p>Can a district court issue a nationwide (universal) injunction that blocks enforcement of a federal executive order beyond the specific parties involved in the lawsuit?</p>\n",
